Task:

1) Convert Do while to while loop?
Ans:
int i=1;
while(i<6)
{
       System.out.println("I will get printed once for sure");
       i++;
}


2) There are some limitations with For-each loop. Can you find what they are?
Ans: 
In for each loop array iterable elements cannot be modified
Index values are not printed so it can’t get index values
The list of array trying to backward traversal but in for each loop it doesn’t traverse backwards


3) When to go for double ? And When to use Float ?
Ans: Double is used when number is large and need accurate result, Ex: 84.77758859395 whereas float is used for storing short number by declaring the value with f. Ex: 84.77f


4) Can char store negative numbers in JAVA?
Ans: No Java cannot store negative values. Java contains all unsigned values so we cannot add signed values in java.


5) Find the Output :
Ans: 22

a++ is post increment that increment value by 1 after assigning to variable that is 11
++a is pre increment that increment value by 1 before assigning to variable that is 11
So 11 + 11 = 22


6) Find the Output :







Ans: 9

It is unary operator and It converts all negative to positive number and if it is positive number, so it converts positive to negative.



7) Explore About Short Circuiting?
Ans: Short circuiting means the first operator decide the final result and second operator will not be checked. E.g. Expression is: True || False. In case of || (OR), One side is to be true and it results true and no need to check second operator.
